## Termination Announcement

The SOAP web service for the E-utilities will be **TERMINATED** permanently on July 1, 2015. All requests made to this service after that date will fail.

If you have software that is currently using the E-utility SOAP web service, please plan to transition to using the standard URL interface described in Chapters 1-4 of this book.

Please contact [vog.hin.mln.ibcn@ofni](mailto:dev@null) if you have questions about this change.
